# PancakeUtils ðŸ¥ž ðŸ§° 
GNU coreutils alternative. Not a fork.
## Why?
To hopefully improve the user-friendliness of the GNU utilities.
## Status report.
pnt, the replacement for GNU cat is pretty much done in its minimalistic form.
## How to compile?
1. Clone this repo.
2. 'make'
3. Copy output from /utils/bin to /usr/bin or wherever you want your binaries want to be stored. No, the makefile doesn't copy binaries yet.
4. Enjoy! :)
