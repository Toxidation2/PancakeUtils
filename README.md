# PancakeUtils ðŸ¥ž ðŸ§° 
GNU coreutils alternative. Not a fork.
## Why?
To hopefully improve the user-friendliness of the GNU utilities.
## Status report.
Nothing interesting yet. Starting to code.
## How to compile? Where is the makefile?
No makefile yet. You must do it manually.
I compile with gcc. Compile like a normal C program, copy to /usr/bin, repeat for all the programs.
Makefile will come in the future.
